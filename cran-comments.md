## Test environments
* Windows 7 x64, R 3.2.2
* ubuntu 12.04, R 3.2.2

## Update of previous version 0.1

* Drop dependance on plyr, stringr, and XML packages.
* Clean up internals to speed up parsing of results.

## Second submission

* The author has been changed: the previous name ("Bill Clay") is a pseudonym 
used during development and was erroneously kept in when the package was first 
submitted to CRAN (see e.g. packages "ameco" and "gesis", which have the same 
combination of author name and email as the current submission). My sincere
apologies for this mistake.
